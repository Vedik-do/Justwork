OverhauledMusic (Forge 1.20.1)

You asked for:
- Mod = does the actions (biomes, bosses, low HP, structures)
- Resource pack = contains the music (.ogg + sounds.json)

What I made:
1) OverhauledMusicForge1201_ACTIONS_ONLY (source)
   - This is the Forge mod PROJECT (actions only). It does NOT include the music files.
   - You build it into a .jar on your PC.

2) OverhauledMusic_MusicPack_1.20.1 (resource pack)
   - Put this ZIP in your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder and enable it.
   - Replace any .ogg inside assets/overhauledmusic/sounds/ to change music.

Install steps (game):
- Install Forge for Minecraft 1.20.1
- Put the built mod .jar into: .minecraft/mods
- Put the resource pack zip into: .minecraft/resourcepacks and enable it in-game

Build steps (PC) (required to create the mod .jar):
- Install Java 17 (Temurin / Adoptium JDK 17)
- Install Gradle 8.7 (or newer 8.x)
- In a terminal inside OverhauledMusicForge1201_ACTIONS_ONLY:
    gradle clean build
- Your mod jar will appear under: build/libs/

Important:
- This environment can't build the jar (no Gradle distribution / no dependency downloads), so I'm delivering the source + the ready resource pack.
