HOW TO BUILD THE JAR (Windows)

1) Install Java JDK 17 (Temurin 17 / Adoptium recommended).
   You can keep Java 25 installed; this builder forces Java 17 for the build.

2) Extract this ZIP (do NOT run from inside the ZIP).

3) Open the extracted folder "OverhauledMusicForge1201_ACTIONS_ONLY" and double-click:
   build-jar.bat

4) When it finishes, your JAR will be here:
   OverhauledMusicForge1201_ACTIONS_ONLY\build\libs\

If something fails, the window will stay open. Scroll up and copy/paste the error.
